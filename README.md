Various efforts for my Hgg analysis. Setup to use TaskVine to submit Coffea processors to condor

Installed Packages:

   * taskvine (via mamba)
   * coffea (calver)
   * fastjet
   * scikit_learn

Other important packages (awkward, hist, etc) will most likely come along with the above

Note: A separate conda environment that includes pytorch is used for the ML work
